##### Proposal Title : A Study of Drug Overdose Death by Month and State

For our project, we are using a dataset collected by the CDC regarding drug related deaths from March 2020 to March 2021. The data is categorized by county, state, month, and number of overdose-related deaths. We would like to determine whether the time of year and climate impact the number of drug related deaths. Do these deaths happen more often in warmer weather? Further north or further south? What factors might contribute to these deaths that aren't visible in the dataset? To do this, we plan to look for the trends by state, noting the environmental factors present in each location.

A difficulty we expect to find is the repetitive nature of county names. In order to avoid this becoming an issue, we will have to run our investigation by state.
