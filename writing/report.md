#### Report Title : Population size and Drug Death in the US

Across the United States, there were over 93,000 provisional drug deaths in 2020. This number is nearly 20,000 higher than was predicted for the year. The increase in stress, the election, COVID-19 and all its variants, all impacted the mental and physical health of US citizens. But are their other, more natural indicators? Does geography, climate, or some other external factor dictate just how severe the rise in drug deaths was? Our group's goal was to answer this question. To do so, we chose 3 US states with similar populations from 3 different climate areas. We chose Washington in the northern part of the country, Arizona in the warm south, and Missouri to act as our mid-country state. We then looked at the provisional drug deaths for the largest and smallest counties in each state by population size. (Note: The smallest counties either had 0 deaths, or a number too small to maintain privacy of the deceased, so they will be excluded from this report.) Finally, we found a county in each state with roughly the same population size (around 66,000) and compared the death rates in these places. We graphed the number of provisional drug deaths from January to December, 2020 and discovered climate had very little to do with the number of deaths. We found that the number of deaths was relatively similar when compared to population size. However, due to this incorrect assumption, we determined that population size had more to do with the number of drug related deaths than any other factors.

First, we looked at the counties with the largest populations in the states of our study. Maricopa is Arizona's largest county by population with 4,420,568 according to the most recent census. This was by far the largest county we looked at, nearly doubling the population of our next largest county. Maricopa also experienced the most drug related deaths with 1,616 in December, 2020. This was a decrease from November's total. We weren't expecting this since the information was additive. However, upon further research we realized that these numbers were provisional because not all of the deaths listed were proven to be drug deaths at the time of the report. If the deaths were determined to not be drug related, they would be removed from the total and the number would decrease. Mistakes like these were common in all of the models, and were more or less pronounced depending on the county's population as well.

King is Washington's largest county with a population of 2,269,675. At its max, King county had 493 provisional drug deaths (not including the 5 that were apparently misreported the month before.) Though the population is a little more than half that of Maricopa, King only experienced a third of the drug related deaths. And while Maricopa experienced approximately 350 deaths during the year, King only experienced 90.
However, this seems to be an outlier. The next largest, St. Louis County, Missouri, experienced over 80, even though their population was only 1,004,125. It might be that King County, Washington has something that makes residents less likely to die of drug related causes, but it doesn't appear to have anything to do with population. St. Louis county is one of the counties we studied that showed a drastic shift in the data. There is a spike then a drop midway through the year, indicative of authorities misreporting the cause of death.

Because the smallest counties in these states didn't have useful data to share, we moved to counties with similar size to determine if the size of the county had any correlation to the number of deaths. We chose Apache County in Arizona, Mason County in Washington, and St. Francois County in Missouri. The population of these counties ranges from approximately 65,700 to approximately 66,900.These counties resulted in the most interesting findings or our research.

These counties, as well as having similar population sizes, experienced similar numbers of drug deaths as well. The steady increase was nearly identical, with spikes occurring in the summer months before numbers decreased and rose steadily again at the end of the year. The only outlier in this case was St. Francois, but looking at these numbers it appears that a lot of misreporting was taking place in this county. It might be important to do further research to determine what has caused those strange variations in the data. St. Francois was the only county where the number of deaths in January was higher than the number of deaths at the end of the year. Despite this, all three counties ended the year with a total of 20-25 deaths. This shows that the number of drug-related deaths is similar in counties of similar size and, therefore, a county's population has more of an effect on the total than external factors such as climate and time of year.
